Slide 1 & 2: Introduction

    Did you know over 60% of investors now consider social media sentiment before making investment decisions in the stock market?

    Good morning, esteemed teachers and respected audience. I am Sushil Uppadhayay, and I am here to present our project titled “Sentimetrics AI: Predicting NEPSE Stock Prices 
    through Sentiment Analysis”, along with my friends Sushant Poudel and Sulav Timalsina.

Slide 3: Objective & Need of the Project

    What is the need for our project, or what are its core objectives?

    The need for Sentimetrics AI arises from the growing influence of social media on NEPSE's market behavior. Social platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and news portals play a crucial 
    role in shaping public sentiment, which in turn affects the stock market.

    Our objective is to detect stock trends early, analyze public sentiment, and use that insight to help predict the direction of NEPSE stock prices. By doing this, we aim to 
    make stock prediction more responsive and real-time, based on social mood rather than just historical numbers.

Slide 4: Literature Review

    Let’s now move into the Literature Review section to explore previous works, identify gaps, and understand the approaches used in past studies.

    Most traditional models rely on historical price and volume data. Some use machine learning but fail to integrate real-time sentiment data.

    Our contribution fills this gap by incorporating natural language processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment extraction, combined with mock and real-time market data to 
    produce predictions for NEPSE stocks.

Slide 5: System Architecture Overview

    Our system is structured into four main layers, each performing a critical role in the overall pipeline:

    Data Ingestion Layer

    Preprocessing & Sentiment Analysis Layer

    Stock Prediction Layer

    Visualization & Output Layer

Slide 6: Data Ingestion Layer

    Let’s understand the Data Ingestion Layer in detail.

    As mentioned earlier, we first simulate or collect data for both NEPSE stock prices and related news or social media posts.

    This is done using a custom-built Python class that:

    1. Loops through selected NEPSE shares

    2. Generates realistic stock prices using trends, sine waves, and market noise

    3. Produces daily news headlines with variable sentiment

    4. Stores this information in CSV format for further analysis

    5. The purpose of this layer is to ensure we have high-quality, time-aligned data for both price and public sentiment, setting a strong foundation for model training and evaluation.
